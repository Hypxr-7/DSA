/**
 * Computes the transitive closure of a directed graph.
 * The transitive closure contains an edge (v,w) if and only if
 * there is a directed path from vertex v to vertex w in the original graph.
 *
 * This implementation precomputes all-pairs reachability by running DFS
 * from each vertex. Query time is O(1), but preprocessing takes O(V*(V+E))
 * time and O(VÂ²) space in the worst case.
 *
 * For sparse graphs, this is efficient for many reachability queries.
 * For dense graphs or few queries, consider using single-source DFS instead.
